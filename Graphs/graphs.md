# Graph
A graph is a data stracture that consists of a set of vertices and edges-represented as 
1. ordered pair of vertices- Directed graph
2. Unordered pair of vertices- Undirected graph.

## Graph terminology
1. **Adjacency** : A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there exists an edge connecting them
2. **Path** : A sequence of edges that allows you to go from a start vertex to a target vertex

## Graph representation
1. **Adjacency list** : An array of linked lists
2. **Adjacency matrix**

## Time complexity
The time complexity of DFS if the entire tree is traversed is O(V)O(V) where V is the number of nodes. In the case of a graph, the time complexity is O(V + E)O(V+E) where V is the number of vertexes and E is the number of edges.
